# Advent of Code 2024 - Javascript Edition

Behold! The solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles, done by a JS Novice.

I'm writing the solutions on the Deno runtime, meaning if you want to run them
yourself you need to have Deno installed.

## Getting your answers

If you want all the answers, do a `deno -A main.ts`. If you want the answer for
single day, do a `deno -A day-01.ts`.
